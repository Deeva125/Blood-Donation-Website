    <h1>What is a blood donation?</h1>
    <h3>Blood donation is a voluntary procedure that can help save the lives of others. There are several types of blood donation. Each type helps meet different medical needs.</h3>
</div>
<div class="types">
    <p> Whole blood donation is the most common type of blood donation, during which you donate about a pint (about half a liter) of whole blood. The blood is then separated into its components — red cells, plasma and sometimes platelets</p>
    <p>During apheresis, you are hooked up to a machine that can collect and separate blood components, including red cells, plasma and platelets, and return unused components back to you.</p>
    <p>Platelet donation (plateletpheresis) collects only platelets — the cells that help stop bleeding by clumping and forming plugs (clotting) in blood vessels. Donated platelets are commonly given to people with clotting problems or cancer and people who will have organ transplants or major surgeries.</p>
    <p>Double red cell donation allows you to donate a concentrated amount of red blood cells. Red blood cells deliver oxygen to your organs and tissues. Donated red blood cells are typically given to people with severe blood loss, such as after an injury or accident, and people with sickle cell anemia.</p>
    <p>Plasma donation (plasmapheresis) collects the liquid portion of the blood (plasma)Plasma helps blood clot and contains antibodies that help fight off infections, Plasma is commonly given to people in emergency and trauma situations to help stop bleeding.</p>
